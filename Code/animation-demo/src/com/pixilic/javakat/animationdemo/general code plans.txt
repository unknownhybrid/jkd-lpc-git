all characters (unless some really weird ghost things are implemented) will have a true unitCollision flag, or maybe we will just say that Characters have unit collision and if something is a Character then it collides and don't even check flags
but some Environment blocks will have different kinds of unit collision flags
example: a ladder
an NPC in a village with a ladder should not be able to climb the ladder
but a player should
so
Order of the next few tasks as I see it:
1. Map loading
2. Movement across a map
3. Unit collision
4. Unit interaction/dialogue boxes/descriptions associated with objects
then after that we can actually do the true game mechanics
and then we are done
that is a massive oversimplification
but that is the general flow as I see it
