MEMENTOS

***Charlie's Addition***
Going based on the idea I added to the universe notes. A Momento is linked with a specific individual, and can even be
linked with several individuals (maybe have a cool brother/sister pair), and no one outside of these individuals can interact
with the momento, as it appears to be an ordinary object. To better explain this, I need to explain how a momento is formed.
In extremely rare instances, a very small region of spacetime will compress more than the area around it, and in order to
return to equilibrium, it will uncompress to match the rest of the area again. If an individual happens to be in this area,
they experience all of the stuff that they would have experienced had the compression of time progressed that far normally.
However, their mind can't really handle it, because it is basically shoving many different lifetimes into their head all
at once. A momento is an object which was also present when this unusual compression occurred, it appears within all
the lifetimes that they experienced. When the individual interacts with it, it brings back memories of what is going 
to happen at any point of the compression. ie. The glasses don't really change how someone sees something, but they provoke
intense memories in that character, essentially of how the future looks.
