The world--
our world--
is crumbling.

And every day I wake up, the sky looks a little less cloudy, and I can feel hope: eminent, satisfying, and refreshing. It looks like I'm the only one who could've started this. With these glasses, this memento of mine, I can see the strings that pull. People don't like that. I get it. It's private. You don't want me to know who hurt you and why. We just met.
But you underestimate the necessity of the situation.


***Charlie's Addition***
"The universe as we know it is ending. Since the beginning, time has been slowly collapsing, this moment and
the next compressing together. Like a balloon, squeeze it to much and... pop... no more universe. No one notices
these changes, as their entire lives are changed as well, everything they remember is exactly as they have always
remembered it. Thing have changed in recent years though, something has caused this compression to happen faster, 
bringing the end of days within our lifetime."

Now, I like the steampunk setting if we go by this idea, since I can totally imagine as time is being squished together,
that elements of the future and the past are going to bleed into each other, which is practically the definition of steampunk.
Also, as the story progresses, especially towards the end of a cycle, I would imagine very drastic and unusual things to
be going on, which could result in some really neat environments (futuristic stuff or even dinosaurs, whatever we want,
maybe even a digital camera ;P )..
