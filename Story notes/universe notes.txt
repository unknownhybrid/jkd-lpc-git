The world--
our world--
is crumbling.

And every day I wake up, the sky looks a little less cloudy, and I can feel hope: eminent, satisfying, and refreshing. It looks like I'm the only one who could've started this. With these glasses, this memento of mine, I can see the strings that pull. People don't like that. I get it. It's private. You don't want me to know who hurt you and why. We just met.
But you underestimate the necessity of the situation.
